#### 1. `POST /update_user_preferences`

Updates or sets the user‚Äôs assessment preferences.

#### Payload:

```json
{
  "user_id": "string",
  "cadre_id": "string",
  "lang": "string",
  "assessment_count": 0 to 7
}
```

- If `num_of_assessments` is `0`, the system defaults to generating 1 assessment.

- New users are added with preferences; existing users‚Äô preferences are updated.

- A background scheduler (runs every Saturday at 11:00 PM) auto-generates assessments for the upcoming week based on stored preferences.

##

Submits the user‚Äôs answers and calculates the score.

#### Payload:

```json
{
  "user_id": "string",
  "assessment_id": "string",
  "user_responses": [
    { "nid": "string", "user_answer": "string" },
    { "nid": "string", "user_answer": "string" },
    { "nid": "string", "user_answer": "string" },
    { "nid": "string", "user_answer": "string" },
    { "nid": "string", "user_answer": "string" }
